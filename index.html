            <p>
                The Marine Technology Society (MTS) is a professional society that serves the international community of
                approximately
                3,800 ocean engineers, technologists, policy-makers, and educators. The goal of the society, which was
                founded in 1963,
                is to promote awareness, understanding, advancement and application of marine technology.The
                association is based
                in Washington, District of Columbia, United States. Former executive directors include Martin Finnerty,
                Judith T.
                Krauthamer and Richard Lawson.
                The society consists of 29 technical disciplines and presently has 17 sections, including overseas
                sections in Japan,
                Korea and Norway. In addition, MTS has 23 student sections at colleges and universities with related
                fields of study.
                The flagship publication of the society is the MTS Journal. The journal is published 6 times annually
                and primarily
                features themed issues consisting of invited papers. The journal has a current ISI Impact Factor of
                0.763
                MTS sponsors several conferences of note, including the OCEANS Conference (co-sponsosed with IEEE/OES),
                Underwater
                Intervention (co-sponsored with ADCI), Dynamic Positioning Conference, biennial Buoy Workshop
                (co-sponsored with the
                Office of Naval Research), and the hot-topic workshop series TechSurge.
                In 1969 the group held its annual convention in Miami Beach. The convention was addressed by Spiro
                Agnew, who was
                then Vice President of the United States.
                In 1993 the laser line scan, a U.S. Navy photography secret, made its debut at the society sponsored
                trade show in New
                Orleans.

                Marine technology professionals play a critical role in international commerce, marine engineering, and
                ocean
                observation. Connect with our international community of experts who have the same passion for the
                oceans as you do.
                Share research, knowledge, and enhance your career through membership in MTS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Marine Technology Society partners with non-profit organizations, government agencies, and
                associations, on
                educational events and initiatives that advance marine science and technology. Employees of these
                organizations join MTS
                to connect and share knowledge with our international community of ocean engineers and scientists.
